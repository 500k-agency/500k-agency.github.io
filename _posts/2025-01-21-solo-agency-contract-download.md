# Essential Elements of a Solid Agency Contract

Hey there! After running an agency for 7+ years, here's what I've learned about
contracts (the hard way, lol). These are the key things you absolutely need in
your agreements:

### 1. Project Scope & Deliverables

- Super detailed breakdown of what you're building
- Features list (be specific!)
- What's NOT included (saves headaches later)
- Any assumptions you're making

### 2. Timeline & Milestones

- Start/end dates
- Major milestone dates
- Review periods
- What happens if dates slip

### 3. Payment Terms

- Payment schedule
- Late payment consequences
- Currency & payment methods
- Kill fee if project ends early

### 4. Change Management

- How scope changes are handled
- Who can request changes
- Impact on timeline/cost
- Change request process

### 5. IP Rights & Ownership

- Who owns the final product
- License terms if applicable
- Code ownership
- Asset ownership

### 6. Communication

- Points of contact
- Meeting frequency
- Response time expectations
- Status report format

### 7. Testing & Acceptance

- Acceptance criteria
- Testing process
- Bug fix policy
- Final sign-off process

### 8. Confidentiality

- NDA terms
- Data handling
- Team access restrictions
- Client info protection

### 9. Exit Clauses

- Termination conditions
- Notice periods
- Deliverable handover
- Final payment terms

Pro tip: get a lawyer to review your first contract template. It's worth the $$,
trust me. At 500K Agency, we learned this stuff through trial and error, but you don't
have to!

Remember: contracts protect both sides. They're not just about covering your butt -
they help create clear expectations and better client relationships.
