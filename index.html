      <p>Hi, My name is Paul. üëã</p>

      <p>
        I started Spacestation Labs back in 2017 as a way to make money as a
        scrappy startup founder.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two years later, I was making twice as much as when I was a full-time
        software developer, and more than I ever did from my startups.
      </p>

      <p>
        Four years later, I helped dozens of rising technology companies grow
        and build products, all while working no more than 40h/week on average.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, six years on, I've afforded the luxury to take the year off,
        travel a bit, and then just relax on my couch. At the end of the day,
        it's freedom I truly want.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, I'm not just sharing how to build a business through effective
        communication, but also how to gain the freedom to pursue any passion
        with flexibility.
      </p>

          The first chapter is insanely well-written and packed with actionable
          advice. That lured me in to want to learn more. Thanks!! BTW, if there
          is a way to buy the book, I'd much prefer that option. Please let me
          know.

          I really enjoyed the chapter you shared on Reddit, there was a ton of
          valuable information in it. I don‚Äôt usually entertain posts like that
          because they‚Äôre usually just repeating the same generic advice about
          working hard. I think you‚Äôre a really well-spoken individual and I
          would love to learn more about your experience.

          I know this is about software development but many of the methods and
          process of getting contracts, thinking outside the box in the first
          chapter on reddit were inspiring to read! I‚Äôd like to hear the rest of
          it and learn from successful people.

          Love this chapter - already has some super good tips - I tend to look
          at any jobs that are full time and immediately dismiss them, but you
          have some really good ideas in here about moving to contract/giving a
          max amount of hours per month instead of "full time" - love it.

          Thank you very much for your insight, already very inspiring! The more
          concise examples and tips on how to achieve things, the better. You
          already did better then everything I read before.

          Awesome thing you've done here man. People charge for an Upwork
          playbook these days, and you are doing this for free. Angel saviour if
          I may say so.
